# max3510x
MAX3510x time-to-digital convertor firmware API

Supported Chips:  MAX35102, MAX35103, and MAX35104

This API fits between the firmware application and a user-supplied SPI driver.  The API abstracts the register set of the MAX3510x family of time-to-digital converters and well a provides a set of functions to convert the time values to floats

Application examples that use this API can be found elsewhere under the maxim-ic-flow github organization.
